## Setup
Ensure you have Kotlin set up in your Android project. You can add Kotlin to your project by adding the Kotlin Gradle plugin to your build.gradle file.

```gradle
// Add Kotlin plugins
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android-extensions'

Basic Usage
In Android, navigation between screens is typically handled using navigation components. Conditional navigation involves making decisions at runtime to navigate to different destinations based on certain conditions.

// Sample code demonstrating conditional navigation using Navigation component
val directions = if (condition) {
    FragmentDirections.actionFragmentAtoFragmentB()
} else {
    FragmentDirections.actionFragmentAtoFragmentC()
}
findNavController().navigate(directions)

Conditional Navigation Techniques

There are various techniques to implement conditional navigation in Android. Here are a few common ones:


Examples
For practical examples and implementations, please refer to the sample code provided in the examples/ directory of this repository.

Conclusion
Conditional navigation is a powerful feature in Android development that allows developers to create dynamic and user-centric navigation flows. By using Kotlin and Android navigation components, you can easily implement conditional navigation in your applications.
